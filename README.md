# Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL statements from spring 2024. The project utilizes the database ExampleDatabase, which 
can be created by running the create database.sql file. The first stage in creating any
database is planning. An effective database starts with an Entity Relationship Diagram and 
a project Specification Sheet. You can view examples of this on my GitHub interface at:

## Communication With the ExampleDatabase

By Selecting any of the SQL query statements from the .sql files, you can 
SELECT, GROUP BY, JOIN, and create views of the example data. SQL queries are 
essential for webpages to communicate with a database. You can explore my work
